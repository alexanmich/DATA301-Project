# DATA301-Project

## Background
The aim of this project was to estimate the effect of COVID-19 on New Zealand spending. By predicting how much kiwis would have spent using data prior to lock-down, I could estimate how much less kiwis were spending. The data used was card transactions sourced from StatsNZ and other government organisations. 

## Results
Using the data prior to March 2020, ARIMA models and forecasting techniques were used to get the expected spending for March-May of 2020. When I compared this to the actual spending over this period it was estimated that kiwis spent $5.8 to $6.5 billion less than expected over the three month period.
